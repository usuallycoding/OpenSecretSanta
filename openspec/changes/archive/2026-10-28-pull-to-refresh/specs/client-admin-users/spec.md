# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Loading, errors and refreshing
Every admin user screen SHALL show that it is loading, SHALL show a message with "Try again" when the server cannot be reached or answers with an error, and SHALL keep what it already shows while a refresh fails. Each screen SHALL be refreshed as described in "Pulling a screen refreshes it" and "The web has no refresh control" and SHALL reload when the app returns to the foreground.

#### Scenario: Server unreachable
- **WHEN** the server cannot be reached while the list loads
- **THEN** the screen says so and offers "Try again"

#### Scenario: Refresh keeps what is shown
- **WHEN** a refresh fails while the list is shown
- **THEN** the list stays on screen with the error message
